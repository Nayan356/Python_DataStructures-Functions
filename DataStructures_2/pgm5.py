# # # How Tuple is beneficial as compare to the list?
# # Answer: List has mutable nature i.e., list can be 
# # changed or modified after its creation according to
# #  needs whereas tuple has immutable nature.
# Tuples are faster than lists.
# It makes your code safer if you “write-protect” 
# data that does not need to be changed. ... 
# Some tuples can be used as dictionary keys 
# (specifically, tuples that contain immutable values like strings, numbers, and other tuples).
